LiVerse is a extensible, hackeable PNG Tuber app for streamers/content creators

LiVerse is still in active development.


## Under Active Development
Creating PR's in this early stage of the project won't be that much helpful, I'll still try to read/accept them, but don't expect every PR to be accepted.
The current branch is not guaranteed to be buildable

### Features:
 - Extensible via plugins (not yet)
 - Built-in documentation (not yet)
 - Lightweight, made with Monogame to ensure good performance
 - Libre! Free and Open Source, licensed under the Apache 2.0 License
